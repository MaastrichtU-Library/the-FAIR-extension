## Quickstart 

To run the extension:<br>
1- Download the project as Zip folder <br>
2- Extract the folder<br>
3- Go to Extensions page in Google Chrome<br>
4- Activate Developer mode on top-right<br>
5-Load unpacked -> downloaded project folder -> select folder<br>
Finally, you can use the extension on the page of your choice.

## Use Cases  

1. A student wanting to make use of a DO (e.g. software package), but doesn't know which to choose. The FAIR extension will indicate which one is more FAIR and aid the decision making process
2. A Data steward recommending sources
3. A researcher who wants to display all FAIR metrics of her DOs on a research profile
4. A PI that wants to evaluate an aggregated metric for a project.

## About üëì

The scientific community‚Äôs efforts have increased regarding evaluating the FAIRness of research Digital Objects such as publications, datasets, or research software. However, this requires a steep learning curve for the average researcher when learning the FAIR evaluation frameworks, disengaging some of them in the process.

This project aims to use technology close this gap and make this process more accessible by bringing the FAIR evaluation to the researcher‚Äôs profiles. ‚ÄúThe FAIR extension‚Äù is an open-source, user-friendly web browser extension that allows researchers to do FAIRness evaluations directly from scholarly aggregators such as PURE, Google Scholar, or ResearchGate without any additional knowledge. The browser extension follows the FAIR metrics group specification, building on top of the community-accepted FAIR evaluators‚Äô APIs.¬†

We aim to demonstrate that using low-entry-level tools can bridge the gap between the researcher and the FAIR metrics. e.g. A data steward recommending FAIR sources or a researcher evaluating all FAIR metrics directly on scholarly profiles.

The development of this extension is made possible thanks to the [Netherlands eScience Center fellowship grant 2022-2023](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/)
